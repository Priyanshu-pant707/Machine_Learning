# Machine Learning

`Have you ever Wondered hoe NetFlix knows what you want to watch next? Or how Google Translate works like magic ? The secret behind it all.. is MACHINE LEARNING . `

- It is all about teaching computers to learn from data-just like we learn from the experience.


- Instead of programming every step,we give machines lots of data and let them figure out patterns on their own.

### Some `Examples` :
1. YouTube Recommendations-learns from your watch history.
2. Spam Detection in Gmail-learns pattern in the spam emails.
3. Voice Assistants(Siri,Alexa)-Learn how you speak.
4. Self-driving Cars- learn to identify stop,signs,pedestrains,and roads
5. Face Unlock on Phones- learns to recognize your face.

### Tradition programming Vs Machine learning
- `Traditional Programming :` - give rules `+` data `->` get result (manual logic writing)
- `Machine Learning  :` - give data `+` result `->` get rules(model) (learns patterns automatically).
