# Linear Regression

- Simple model for predicting the continuous values
- its finds relationship between the input feature and  output.



# How linear Regression Work ?
- finds the  best-fitting line by miimizing prediction errors (least squares method).

- best fit line equation
   ```
   y=mx+c

   m->slope
   c -> intercept
   x-> data point
   y->prediction
   ```
     
- it calculates coefficeints for variables that minimize the error in predictions.




# How to make best fit line ?

```
y = c + b1(x1) + b2(x2)

where,

y is Dependent Variable
c is Constant
b1 is First Regression Coefficient
x1 is First Independent Variable
b2 is Second Regression Coefficient
x2 is Second Independent Variable
```


- we have find the best value for the slope and intercept 
- Residual Error should be used, it should be minimum.


# Residual Error :
- difference between the actual point and the predictive point
- line with the certain intercept and slop value giving the least residual error should be consider best fit line.




# types of Linear Regression 
- Simple Linear Regression
   -  predicts the dependent variable using a single independent vairable.

- Multiple Linear Regression
   -Uses two or more independent variables to predict the depentdent variable.
