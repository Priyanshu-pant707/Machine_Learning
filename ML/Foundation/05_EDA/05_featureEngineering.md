# Feature Engineering :

- creating new features or transforming existing ones to expose useful patterns that ml models can learn from


##  why do we need it?
 - beacuse ml models don't know domain logic ->  we have to give them right signals.


## common feature engineering techniques in ml :
1. Mathematical combinations
2. Target-based flags
3. Binning (when it helps)
4. Time-based features (if time exists).
