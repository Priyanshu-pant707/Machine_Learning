# Types Of Machine Learning

- Machine learning has 3 major types.

---

# 1. SUPERVISED LEARNING :
- `Game of Prediction`
- It is like a student being taught by a teacher .
- We give the machine input and the correct answer - and it learns to predict.
- 99% machine learning applications work on the supervised learning.
- We have both input and output variables.

`But the training of a model are done using various methods and these ,methods are knonwn as algorithms.`

### supervised learning algorithms:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression 
3. K-Nearest NeighBors 
4. Gradient Boosting
5. Decision Tree
6. Naive Bayes

# 2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING :

- Here also we will get the data but we are not going to predict anything we will just find patterns,Group similar items, Reduce Complexity, spot outliers.
- eg- Google Search.
- it is also used in the training the model for the supervised learning.

# 3. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING :

- Reinforcement learning is like training a dog. You don't teach it everything directly - instead , you reward good behavior and ignore or punish bad actions.
- Over time, the dog learns what actions give it treats, That's the core of RL-learning by trial and error.
